# HTMx-Dictionary

A small application to combine API requests with HTMx, a JavaScript library designed to extend the ability of HTML. Among other features, it allows POST/GET requests to be made without reloading the page, inserting the response directly in to any chosen element in the DOM.

Django combined with HTMx is considered a good combination as it compliments Django and its features. It allows for more maintainable front-end for small scale projects.

HTMx is a popular library with Django developers so this was a demonstration of implementing one of the features, offering AJAX requests without the need of large JavaScript front-end frameworks.
